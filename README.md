**Microservices Anti-Patterns**
- Don’t build microservices
- Not taking automation seriously
- Don’t build nanoservices
- Don’t turn into SOA
- Don’t build a gateway for each service
  
**Twelve Factor Methodology** (to build **scalable**, **maintainable**, and **portable** applications)
1. Codebase - "One codebase tracked in version control, many deploys."
2. Dependencies - "Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies."
3. Config - "Store config in the environment."
4. Backing Services - "Treat backing services as attached resources."
5. Build, Release, Run - "Strictly separate build, release, and run stages."
6. Processes - "Execute the app as one or more stateless processes."
7. Port Binding - "Export services via port binding."
8. Concurrency - "Scale out via the process model."
9. Disposability - "Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown."
10. Dev/Prod Parity - "Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible."
11. Logs - "Treat logs as event streams."
12. Admin Processes - "Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes."
